#Adventure Game 

Adventure is a text-based game in which the player navigates through different buildings on U of I's campus to reach the final destination. Along the way, they can pick up various items that will assist them on their journey and help defeat the many monsters they will face.

This program was built using Java. All of the information used to create the game world (locations, monsters, items, etc) is stored within JSON files.
